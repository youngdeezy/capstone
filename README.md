DATA 606 Capstone Project 

https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/geospatial-data-python

https://github.com/sheilaalemany/hurricane-rnn

Program that compiles a list of hurricane events spanning back to 1950 into a GeoPandas DataFrame. The program can then be used to specify a specific hurricane event to plot out the hurricane track of the selected hurricane event into a map of the U.S.

Contains a script that is able to train and deploy a Recurrnet Neural Network that predicts the track of a hurricane through a grid-based system

The files in the folder 606 Capstone are required to run the program

Due to some combatiability issues I had with the plugins and my computer, this was done through Google Colab
